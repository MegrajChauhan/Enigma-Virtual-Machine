# Enigma Virtual Machine #

### A simple virtual machine written in C++. It can execute many instructions[see CPU/EnigmaInstructions.hpp for how each instructions work] In the Tests folder, there are currently two tests that. If you are interested, you can execute them yourself. The documentation for the VM will be coming soon. ###  

 ### There is no make file or Cmake file since i don't know how to make it just yet. There will be updates in the future where more new instructions and features will be added.###  
  
  ### The assembler to this VM will also be coming soon. ###
